`.gitignore`

This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore and not commit to the repository. This is crucial for avoiding temporary files, dependency folders, and sensitive/large data.

```gitignore
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyd
*.pyo

# IDE/Editor files (common ones)
.idea/  # PyCharm
.vscode/ # VS Code
*.swp   # Vim

# Dependency files
venv/
env/
.env

# Project-specific files to ignore
# The data file is usually kept in VCS for small projects, 
# but for production systems, it should be ignored. For this 
# mini-project, we'll ignore potential backups.
*.bak
*.tmp
